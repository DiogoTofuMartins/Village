# Village
This games consists on a text-base virtual game that represents the classic Village game.
There are four different types of characters: Villagers, one Psychic, one WereWolf and one Priest.
The Priest has the power to pick someone and save that person from being killed by the wolf.
The WereWolf can pick someone to kill and that person must die. It will only survive if that person was picked by the Priest.
The Psychic has the power to give a hunch of who it thinks is the WereWolf and the game will only tell her if her choice is right or wrong.
Everytime, after all these three charachters use their superpowers, all the players must vote in someome they think that is the WereWolf.
The Villagers can only vote, they do not have superpowers.
The person who get the majority of votes is killed.
All the players can chat with each other while they are not voting or while the Psychic, the Priest and the WereWolf are making their decisions.
The WereWolf wins if it kills everyone in the game.
The other players win if the WereWolf is killed by the voting method.
